# JATE
This is the Jate app, it allowes the user to take notes or edit text aswell as download the app to work offline. The information gets saved into the database and is retreived when the app goes back online, so any changes done are reflected when network is online.

The app uses service worker to help tell the device how to handle the app once downloaded,
a manifest file to help the browser install the app on the device.

Overall this is a very simple app but does a great job at demonstration what a PWA app is.
